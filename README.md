# mrs

This is an experiment in creating a Python library designed to detect names of people with the structure "Mrs. \[male first name\] \[last name\]," such as "Mrs. Ralph Mayer" or "Mrs. Tom√°s Rivera." It uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [gender-guesser](https://pypi.org/project/gender-guesser/). 

It comes out of a library and archives metadata context, where dated descriptions don't always align with current modes of address. The goal is to identify potential instances where women were not identified by their own names, in order to target those instances for revision and further research where needed. 

This is a work in progress, written as an exploratory experiment by someone who is primarily a metadata librarian rather than a developer.

## Usage
```python
import mrs

data = mrs.Text(input_string)

for entity in data.mrs_names:
    name = mrs.Name(entity)
    if name.format == "first_last":
    	print(name.text, name.gender_guess)
    	
```
